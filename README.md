# CrecelleHack: A 3.7 Variant

CrecelleHack is an actively maintained variant of NetHack 3.7. Delve into
a lush, growing dungeon filled with strange creatures and retrieve the
Amulet of Yendor for your god.

## Design Goals

- Craft a dungeon that feels more "alive." This place isn't just a deathtrap,
  it's a home.
- Promote strategic gameplay and open up additional character development
  options.
- Add monsters and items that are interesting for reasons beyond their stat
  blocks.
- Implement ideas that seem impossible to implement in NetHack.

## FAQ

### What license is this under?

CrecelleHack of course falls under the NetHack license.

### What happened to SpliceHack?

SpliceHack is no longer maintained. This variant is, in many ways, a design
evolution of SpliceHack. It's more focused, more tightly coded, less buggy,
and takes greater care in its depictions of mythology.

### Why doesn't this variant support tiles?

I love supporting tileset-based play, and I wish I could. Unfortunately, many
of the features in CrecelleHack are impossible to represent graphically and
rely on ascii for presentation. Any kind of tiles support would require
significant changes in how graphical tiles are handled.

### How do I report a bug?

Open up a github issue, or contact me in IRC or Discord. This goes for bugs
as well as YANIs, YASIs, and EPIs. Please don't bother the NetHack DevTeam
about anything in this variant.

Please don't hesitate to open up an issue. I'm human and I make mistakes; 
if something in the game is broken, insensitive, or just plain not fun, I would
always rather know.

### How do I compile this?

Exactly as you would compile vanilla NetHack 3.7.

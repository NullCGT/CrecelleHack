# Stamina
- Stamina is a new stat that increases with level. Swinging
  a weapon costs stamina, and it regenerates rapidly over
  time. If your stamina hits zero, all actions will cost
  additional movement until your stamina is no longer zero.
- Different weapons require different amounts of stamina to
  swing.
- Only naturally regen health if stamina is full.
- Ascending a staircase or ladder requires full stamina.
- Eating food restores stamina.

  tourists (always human).

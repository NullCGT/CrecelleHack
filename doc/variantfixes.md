    type to the original type of the artifact. For example,
    Sunsword cannot be a mace.

  and execute grabs more easily.

  already grappling an opponent.

  whips, and flails can be used to trip as well.

  applies to both players and monsters.

  are prepended by the word "You" when used in game.

  weapon, such as a quarterstaff, two-bladed sword, or dual axe.

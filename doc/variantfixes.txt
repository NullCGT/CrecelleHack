# 1.0
## System Changes
### Reflection
- Reflection does not reflect rays directly back at
  the one that fired them. Instead, the rays bounce off at a ninety degree
  angle. As a consequence, reflection no longer instantly kills Medusa.

## Attributes
### General
- Dexterity contributes to AC.
- Strength is normally the sole contributor to to-hit.

## Artifacts
### Type Randomization
- Many artifacts have semi-randomized object types.
  - The randomized object type must have a similar damage
    type to the original type of the artifact. For example,
    Sunsword cannot be a mace.
  - The brands are always the same type.

## Armor
### MC
- MC: Chance of cancelling a special effect.
  - Every piece of armor adds some amount of magic cancellation.
  - Maxes out at 90%.
  - Each point of enchantment reduces the MC of that piece of equipment by 1%.

## GUI
- MC is displayed on the status line as a percentage.

## Weapons
### Finesse Weapons
- Some weapons are "finesse weapons." To-hit bonuses with
  finesse weapons are determined based on strength or
  dexterity, whichever is higher.
- Some weapons have a speed bonus or a speed penalty.
  - Generally, orc weapons are faster, elven weapons deal more damage,
    and dwarvish weapons deal more damage but are slower.
### To-Hit Changes
- As in dNetHack, d(1, Luck) is added to your to-hit instead
  of Luck.
- New To-Hit bonuses:
  Restricted: -2
  Unskilled: 0
  Basic: +1
  Skilled: +2
  Expert +3
- New Damage bonuses:
  Restricted: -2
  Unskilled: 0
  Basic: +1
  Skilled: +2
  Expert: +3

## Floor Coating System
- Floors can be coated with various substances, such as potions, grass,
  blood, and more.
- Grass can be set afire. Fire is a new type of region which spreads over
  nearby flammable terrain.
- Lightning is conducted by pools, blood, and spilled potions.

# Roles and Races
### General
- Roles are not restricted by race, with the exception of
  tourists (always human).
### Knights
- Knights receive a different mount depending on race.
  Orcs: Warg
  Elves: Jaguar

## Monsters

  to both disguise himself and summon illusory duplicates.

  by liches.

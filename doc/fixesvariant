# 1.0

## Attributes
- Dexterity contributes to AC.
- Strength is normally the sole contributor to to-hit.

## Artifacts
- Many artifacts have semi-randomized object types.
  - The randomized object type must have a similar damage
    type to the original type of the artifact. For example,
    Sunsword cannot be a mace.
  - The brands are always the same type.

## Weapons
- Some weapons are "finesse weapons." To-hit bonuses with
  finesse weapons are determined based on strength or
  dexterity, whichever is higher.
- Some weapons have a speed bonus or a speed penalty.
  - Generally, orc weapons are faster, elven weapons deal more damage,
    and dwarvish weapons deal more damage but are slower.
- As in dNetHack, d(1, Luck) is added to your to-hit instead
  of Luck.

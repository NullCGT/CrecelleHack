# 1.0

## Attributes
- Dexterity contributes to AC.
- Strength is normally the sole contributor to to-hit.

## Artifacts
- Many artifacts have semi-randomized object types.
  - The randomized object type must have a similar damage
    type to the original type of the artifact. For example,
    Sunsword cannot be a mace.
  - The brands are always the same type.

## Weapons
- Some weapons are "finesse weapons." To-hit bonuses with
  finesse weapons are determined based on strength or
  dexterity, whichever is higher.
- Some weapons have a speed bonus or a speed penalty.
  - Generally, orc weapons are faster, elven weapons deal more damage,
    and dwarvish weapons deal more damage but are slower.
- As in dNetHack, d(1, Luck) is added to your to-hit instead
  of Luck.
- New To-Hit bonuses:
  Restricted: -2
  Unskilled: 0
  Basic: +1
  Skilled: +2
  Expert +3
- New Damage bonuses:
  Restricted: -2
  Unskilled: 0
  Basic: +1
  Skilled: +2
  Expert: +3
- To compensate for the new to-hit and damage bonuses, the player
  starts the game with no skills allocated to their weapons.

# Floor Coating System
- Floors can be coated with various substances, such as potions and grass.
- Grass can be set afire. Fire is a new type of region which spreads over
  nearby flammable terrain.
- Known Issues:
  - Areas with multiple coatings are not properly described when using
    (:) to check what is here.
  - Fire region code makes an assumption that fire will be 1x1 regions.
    For efficiency purposes we may want to modify this in the future.
  - Potions should alchemize on the floor when shed by a monster, not
    only when a potion splatters. Need to pull out a function.
  - inside_bonfire() code needs serious cleanup!
  - Special rooms are outlined by a coating due to some type of flag
    collision.

# Roles and Races
- Roles are not restricted by race, with the exception of
  tourists (always human).
- Knights receive a different mount depending on race.
  Orcs: Warg
  Elves: Jaguar

## Monsters
- The following monster classes are now valid mounts: f, d
- New Monster: Poltergeist ( )
  - Does not approach, collects objects like a nypmph. Throws any and
    all objects it gets its hands on.
- New Monster: Grotesque (g)
  - Slow, hard to hit, and very high damage. Spawns in groups.
- New Monster: Mascaron (g)
  - Stunning gaze. Spawns in groups.
  - Peaceful, but turns hostile if alignment is abused.

## Monster AI
- Elves and princes can engrave Elbereth to ward off the player.
  - TODO: Forbid ranged attacks while on Elbereth?
  - TODO: Intentionally break Elbereth when player hp is low?
  - TODO: Elbereth vanishment?
- Some monsters will avoid following the player into chokepoints.
- Incorporated Slash'Em's traitor system, but updated to 3.7.
- Monsters will only flee from the player if they could conceivably
  outrun them.
- Monsters will slather items with cans of grease if the player is
  polymorphed into a relevant form.

## Objects
- Potions of water are considered inert and do not polymorph.
- Potions leave behind empty bottles when drunk. These bottles
  can be refilled with water at fountains, sinks, and other
  locations.

## Commands
- #trip: Trip a monster.
  - Tripping traditionally uses one's lower body, but polearms,
    whips, and flails can be used to trip as well.
  - Being tripped puts one into a downed state. Until one moves
    to a different location, AC and to-hit are reduced.
  - Select monsters or monsters wielding tripping weapons will
    sometimes attempt to trip the player.
- #taunt: Taunt nearby monsters.
  - Wastes a few turns and wakes up nearby monsters.
